## What is Renata?

Renata is a premium, multi-user meeting intelligence platform. It autonomously joins your **Google Meet and Zoom** calls, records the audio, and runs it through a multi-stage AI pipeline powered by **Google Gemini**. It delivers structured meeting intelligence — full transcripts, summaries, minutes of meeting (MOM), action items, speaker analytics, and a searchable knowledge base — all isolated per user and accessible from a high-performance web dashboard.

Built with **FastAPI**, **SQLite**, and **OAuth 2.0**, RENATA is designed to be a secure, scalable, and self-hosted alternative to enterprise tools like Read.ai.

## New in v1.1: Multi-User & Deep Integrations

### 👥 Secure Multi-User Core
- **Data Isolation**: Every user has their own secure profile. Meetings, transcripts, and analytics are private and isolated by user email.
- **Personalized Experience**: Individual settings for bot names, recording preferences, and language synthesis.

### 🔐 Modern OAuth 2.0 Flows
- **Google Sign-In**: Securely authenticate with your Google account. No manual token management required.
- **Zoom Direct Connect**: Link your Zoom account via OAuth to allow RENATA to manage meetings directly from your Zoom host profile.

### 🌐 Integrations Hub
- A centralized dashboard to manage your connections to **Google Calendar, Gmail, Google Drive, and Zoom**.
- Real-time connection status and quick-launch actions for each service.

## Core Features

### 🤖 Autonomous Bot
- Auto-joins scheduled meetings from **Google Calendar** at the exact start time.
- Supports **Google Meet** and **Zoom** via Playwright automation.
- Silent entry with camera off and mic muted.
- Auto-leaves when the meeting ends or stays empty for too long.
- Manual "Add to Live Meeting" trigger with per-user context.

### 🎙️ Gemini AI pipeline
- **Direct Gemini Processing**: Meeting recordings are uploaded to the Gemini File API for state-of-the-art long-context processing.
- **Transcription**: Uses **Gemini 3 Flash** for word-for-word accuracy with timestamps (fallback to **Gemini 2.5 Flash**).
- **Local Diarization**: NVIDIA NeMo TitaNet-L runs locally to accurately attribute speech to specific speakers.
- **Deep Intelligence**: Structured JSON generation for English/Hindi summaries, MOM, and actionable tasks.
- **Professional Reports**: Clean PDF exports with full Hindi font support.

### 📊 Intelligence Dashboard
- **Production-Ready Web UI**: High-performance FastAPI backend with Jinja2 templates.
- **Speaker Analytics**: Talk-time distribution, engagement scores, and pacing metrics.
- **Real-time Status**: Track upcoming, in-progress, and completed meetings on a unified timeline.

### 🔍 AI Search Assistant (RAG)
- **Unified Knowledge Base**: Sync your meeting archive into a `ChromaDB` vector store.
- **Gemini RAG Reasoning**: Ask anything about your past meetings and get precise answers powered by Gemini's reasoning over your private, user-scoped data.

```env
# AI & Database
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
SESSION_SECRET=a_random_secure_string

# Zoom OAuth (Optional)
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID=your_zoom_id
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_zoom_secret
```

#### 🔑 Google Sign-In Setup (Required for Login)
